# Suzuki Burgman 650

- Underseat compartment has automatic light
- Leg shield has 3 storage compartments
    - Lower one has a 12V outlet
- Two CVT maps
    - "Power" mode always keeps engine revs high, useful when riding downhill for stronger engine braking

## Pros
- Comfortable
- Underseat compartment fits a gaming PC with a full set of peripherals

## Cons
- CVT screw is bad engineering
- Lots of mechanics that know what they're dealing with refuse to service it. Notable exception is [Rascal Motorcycles](https://rascalmoto.lv/) who's experienced with this model.

## Mods installed
- Changed underseat compartment light bulb to LED. I used ["Festoon 30mm" type](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004501655224.html) but i think 28mm would be a better fit as i had to stretch retainer contacts uncomfortably far
