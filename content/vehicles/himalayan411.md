## Tripper Pod
I'm not happy with it, and use it as a clock basically. 

Many reviewers complained it's not level from factory, but it's an easy fix - remove windscreen, undo two screws holding the pod, rotate and tighten the screws. Holes on the mounting plate are slightly bigger than bushings - it's both a cause of defect, and a way to fix.

On my particular unit, firmware is out of date and i cannot update it. I tried both iOS and Android app versions, including sideloading older versions of Android app, and "Software Update" menu item is disabled in every version i managed to log into.

What i did not try yet is _indian_ version of the app. From what i researched, it's often more up to date than international version but requires indian phone number to log in. I don't have access to indian phone number and free SMS redirection services did not seem to receive verification code.
